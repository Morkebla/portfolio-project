            <h2 class="heading">My Journey</h2>
            <h3>To <span>Software Development</span></h3>
            <p>I was first introduced to game development by my older brother and Game Maker. Naturally, I began to question things and learn new skills. I wanted to know more about programming languages, and that's when my brother recommended C# to me. This marked the beginning of my software development journey.

            I became curious about everything. I started doing Udemy courses on C# and Unity, as well as C++, and I also delved into Unreal Engine. As my confidence grew, I completed the JustIT bootcamp. With these experiences behind me and my natural curiosity for mastering programming, I am determined to become the best in the world at what I do.

                <h3><span>Education</span></h3>
                <p>In my university journey, which began in February 2023, I embarked on a path fueled by a passion for technology and programming. Starting with Mathematics and Information Technologies, I worked through MU123 and TM111, where I not only passed with distinction but also honed a diverse set of foundational skills.

                In MU123, the world of mathematics was revealed before me. I mastered numerical operations, algebraic manipulations, and statistical analyses. TM111 then introduced me to the realm of computing and information technology. From understanding hardware intricacies to Programming basics, each concept further fueled my curiosity and drive.
                    
                Currently navigating TM112 and TM129, I find myself expanding upon the solid foundation laid by their predecessors. Having completed the networking block, I now possess a comprehensive understanding of network operations, troubleshooting techniques, and security measures. With every module, my journey is not just about accumulating knowledge but also about nurturing a mindset of continuous learning and innovation, ready to tackle new challenges and contribute meaningfully to the ever-evolving field of information technology.

                    <h4><Span>Assault</span></h4>
                    <p>Assault" is one of the first projects I developed using Unity and C#. It's a timeline shooter game where the game pushes you forward towards enemies, and you have to shoot or avoid the targets.</p>

                    <h4><Span>A* Algorithm</span></h4>
                    <p>The A* algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm that determines the shortest route from point A to point B. However, its implementation is more challenging than it seems, as it requires navigating through a complex web of logic. I applied this algorithm in a strategy game where units move along the designated path upon clicking, utilizing the nearest available route.</p>

                    <p>I developed 'Castle Defence' during a C# course, employing the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for pathfinding. Players have the freedom to strategically place towers anywhere on the map. Should they impede enemy movement, the algorithm dynamically resets to find an alternative path.</p>

                    <p>I challenged myself with something new by developing the grid and unit spawns for a game. In this game, players open a menu screen on the side, choose an icon to represent their character, with each icon corresponding to a unique character. Players can then place their chosen character anywhere on the playing board.</p>

                    <p>I had the opportunity to collaborate with a team of six on a game jam, 'Frogwatch' made with unity and C# where my main focus was UI design. I was responsible for nearly every aspect of the game's UI, with only a few exceptions. I take great pride in this project, as it offers both fun and engaging gameplay.</p>
