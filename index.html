                <h3><span>Education</span></h3>
                <p>Currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computing and IT. I've completed first-year modules, earning distinctions in Mathematics for Computing (MU123) and Introduction to Computing and IT 1 (TM111). These courses strengthened my understanding of mathematical logic, computing fundamentals, and software development. I have also completed Introduction to Computing and IT 2 (TM112) and Technologies in Practice (TM129), where I gained hands-on experience with networking, Linux, and robotics. Results for these modules are pending.</p>

                    <p>Assault" is one of the first projects I developed using Unity and C#. It's a timeline shooter game where the game pushes you forward towards enemies, and you have to shoot or avoid the targets.</p>

                    <h4><Span>A* Algorithm</span></h4>
                    <p>The A* algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm that determines the shortest route from point A to point B. However, its implementation is more challenging than it seems, as it requires navigating through a complex web of logic. I applied this algorithm in a strategy game where units move along the designated path upon clicking, utilizing the nearest available route.</p>

                    <p>I developed 'Castle Defence' during a C# course, employing the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for pathfinding. Players have the freedom to strategically place towers anywhere on the map. Should they impede enemy movement, the algorithm dynamically resets to find an alternative path.</p>

                    <p>I challenged myself with something new by developing the grid and unit spawns for a game. In this game, players open a menu screen on the side, choose an icon to represent their character, with each icon corresponding to a unique character. Players can then place their chosen character anywhere on the playing board.</p>

                    <p>I had the opportunity to collaborate with a team of six on a game jam, 'Frogwatch' made with unity and C# where my main focus was UI design. I was responsible for nearly every aspect of the game's UI, with only a few exceptions. I take great pride in this project, as it offers both fun and engaging gameplay.</p>

                    <p>This puzzle game, created for the GMTK Game Jam 2024, revolves around manipulating objects to adjust their sizes and observe how their weights change. Players use a scale to measure these weights and aim to determine the exact weight of each item by experimenting with different sizes and combinations. The gameplay encourages exploration and problem-solving in a fun, interactive environment.                    </p>
